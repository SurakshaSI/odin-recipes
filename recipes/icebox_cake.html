        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>Because icebox cakes are a no-bake dessert, they are usually quick and easy to 
            make. And, as a bonus, they don not heat up the kitchen in the summer. Simply
            whip cream and spread onto wafer cookies. The assembly is quick, but plan
            ahead, as icebox cakes need about four to six hours to set in the fridge.
